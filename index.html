        <h1 class="today">Our Donate Plan</h1>
        <p class="middle">Kids can take action to help the <br>poor and needy in their local community or in other lands. <br> Kids can get their family to donate money, <br> or get together with others to hold a fund-raising drive.</p>

            <h3> <i class="fa-solid fa-bowl-food"></i> <br> Food for a child</h3> 
            <p style="font-size: small;">For instance, you can help clean their clothes, cook or clean the orphanages. Time is money; the most valuable and precious thing you can give to a needy person. When a street kid approaches you, listen to them, learn more about them, their names and what they like and how you can help them.</p>

        <div class="plan-b"> 
            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-house-chimney-window"></i> <br> Shelter for a family</h3> 
            <p style="font-size: small;">Shelter is a basic human need crucial for survival in case of natural hazards and human-induced disasters, including conflict. It provides security, personal safety and protection from the weather, and prevents health problems and diseases.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="plan-c"> 
            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-school"></i> <br> Education for a child</h3>
            <p style="font-size: small;">Education. In general, street children in Bangladesh cannot go to school and miss out on a proper education. This often leads them to lives of hardship, but some non-government organisations offer educational opportunities to provide them with training in basic subjects</p>

            <p> If your kids know a skill — such as playing an instrument, is good at a particular sport or hobby — encourage them to teach those skills to others. Teaching others is a fantastic way for them to make a difference in another child's life and helps them develop their own skills further at the same time</p> <br>
